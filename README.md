# Phone-Addiction-Analysis
Analyzed teen phone usage and its impact on mental health and academics. Built a model to flag addiction risk using behavioral data. Visualized patterns, correlations, and screen time insights.
# 📱 Teen Phone Addiction Analysis

This project analyzes teen phone usage patterns and their effects on mental health, sleep, and academic performance. We apply data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling using Python.

## 🔍 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis on screen time habits
- Mental health and academic performance correlation
- Weekday vs weekend usage comparison
- Phone addiction flagging logic
- Predictive model to classify high-risk users

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv`) includes demographic, behavioral, and self-reported mental health data.

## 📌 Conclusion

Excessive screen time, especially before bed, strongly correlates with poor mental health and lower academic performance. Our model helps flag high-risk individuals for potential early intervention.
